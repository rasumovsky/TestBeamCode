This package is designed to analyze data for the T3MAPS chip and the FE-I4 chip 
from the SLAC test beam and correlate hits between the two. Several classes are
included, and a short description of each is provided below.


LoadT3MAPS.cxx
  This program is designed to load the T3MAPS history.txt output textfile and 
  produce a TTree that is ROOT-readable. 
  
	public methods:
	    LoadT3MAPS( string inFileName, string outFileName ); // constructor
	    int getNEvents(); // returns the number of integration periods
	    TTree* getTree(); // returns pointer to the TTree storing data.


TestBeamAnalysis.cxx
  This program uses TTrees to look at the T3MAPS and FE-I4 module data. 



Initialize the wrapper classes.

Loop over T3MAPS ‘events’

Loop over FEI4 ‘events’ in same time period


If both T3MAPS and FEI4 have hits,
loop over FEI4 hits, 


*** Simple test: ratio of T3MAPS hits to FEI4 hits in given live-time.
